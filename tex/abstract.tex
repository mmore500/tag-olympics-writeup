This Hot-off-the-Press paper summarizes our recently published work, ``Matchmaker, Matchmaker, Make Me a Match: Geometric, Variational, and Evolutionary Implications of Criteria for Tag Affinity.''
This work appeared in Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines.
Genetic programming systems commonly use tag matching to decide interactions between system components.
However, the implications of criteria used to determine affinity between tags with respect evolutionary dynamics have not been directly studied.
We investigate differences between tag-matching criteria with respect to geometric constraint and variation generated under mutation.
In experiments, we find that tag-matching criteria can influence the rate of adaptive evolution and the quality of evolved solutions.
Better understanding of the geometric, variational, and evolutionary properties of tag-matching criteria will facilitate more effective incorporation of tag matching into genetic programming systems.
By showing that tag-matching criteria influence connectivity patterns and evolutionary dynamics, our findings also raise fundamental questions about the properties of tag-matching systems in nature.
