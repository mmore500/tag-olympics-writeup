\section{Software and Data Availability}

We implemented our experimental systems using the Empirical library for scientific software development in C++, available at \url{https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical} \citep{charles_ofria_2019_2575607}.
The code used to perform and analyze our experiments, our figures, and data from our experiments is available via the Open Science Framework at \url{https://osf.io/gw5mc/} \citep{foster2017open}.
