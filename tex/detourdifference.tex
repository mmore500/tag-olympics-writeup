\section{Detour Difference}

\input{fig/detour_difference.tex}

To get a sense of the regularity, in a looses sense, of each space we uniformly sampled triplets of points $A$, $B$, and $C$.
Then, for each metric $m$ we calculated the statistic $m(A, B) + m(B, C) - m(A, C)$.
If the triangle inequality is respected this statistic should be greater than or equal to zero.
Figure \ref{fig:detour_difference} plots the distribution of this statistic for each metric.
The hamming, hash, and streak metrics show evidence of ``shortcuts'' that violate the triangle inequality.
It should be noted that the raw hamming metric does respect the triangle inequality.
