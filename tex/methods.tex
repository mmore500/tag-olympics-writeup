\subsection{Implementation}

We implemented our experimental system using the Empirical library for scientific software development in C++, available at \url{https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical}.
The code used to perform and analyze our experiments, our figures, data from our experiments, and a live in-browser demo of our system is available via the Open Science Framework at \url{https://osf.io/TODO/}.
