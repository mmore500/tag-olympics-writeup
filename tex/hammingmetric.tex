\section{Hamming Metric} \label{sec:hammingmetric}

Each tag was represented as an ordered, fixed-length bitstring,
\begin{align*}
t = \langle t_0, t_1, t_2, \dots, t_{n-2}, t_{n-1} \rangle
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
\forall i, t_i \in \{0, 1\}.
\end{align*}

This metric is based on the work of \citep{lalejini2019else}, originally after TODO hamming cite(?).

In this metric, we compare tags according to their bitwise hamming distance.
Mathematically speaking for tags $t$ and $u$ we compute the distance according to the metric $M$ as,
\begin{align*}
M(t, u)
= \frac{
  \#\{ i : t_i \neq u_i, i=0, \dots ,n-1\}
}{
  n
}
\end{align*}

This metric is commutative and $n$-dimensional.
