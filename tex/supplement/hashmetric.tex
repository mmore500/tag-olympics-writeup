\section{Hash Metric} \label{sec:hashmetric}

This metric is original to the our paper and meant to serve as a control.

The an arbitrary, but determinsitic value, uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.

We rely on the \texttt{hash\_combine} function, adapted from BOOST (TODO cite).

for two values \texttt{v1} and \texttt{v2}, \texttt{hash\_combine} is defined as follows
\begin{verbatim}
unsigned int hash_combine(
  unsigned int v1,
  unsigned int v2
) {
  return v1 ^ (
    v2 * 0x9e3779b9
    + (v1 << 6) + (v1 >> 2)
  );
}
\end{verbatim}

We compute the hash value of a tag as follows
\begin{verbatim}
unsigned int h(unsigned char *tag) {
  unsigned int result = tag[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < 4; ++i){
    result = hash_combine(result, t[i]);
  }
  return result;
}
\end{verbatim}
where \texttt{tag} is the tag's bitstring stored as an array of bytes.

To compute the metric $H$ we then call \texttt{hash\_combine} to combine the hash values of the tags $t$ and $u$
\begin{align*}
H(t, u) = \texttt{hash\_combine( h(}t\texttt{), h(}u\texttt{))}
\end{align*}

Note that this is not commutative.
