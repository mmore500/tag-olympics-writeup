\section{Streak Metric} \label{sec:streakmetric}

Each tag was represented as an ordered, fixed-length bitstring,
\begin{align*}
t = \langle t_0, t_1, t_2, \dots, t_{n-2}, t_{n-1} \rangle
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
\forall i, t_i \in \{0, 1\}.
\end{align*}

This metric was originally proposed by \citep{downing2015intelligence}.
Downing claims that it exhibits
It is computed according to the ratio between the longest contiguously matching substring among two bitsets and the longest contiguously mismatching substring among those two bitsets.
Downing claims that this metric exhibits greater robustness compared to integer and hamming distance metrics using mutational walk experiments but does not demonstrate it in an evolving system.

We define the greatest contiguously-matching length of $n$-long bitstrings $t$ and $u$ as follows,
\begin{align*}
m(t, u) = \max(\{i - j \forall i, j \in 0..n-1 \mid \forall q \in i..j, t_q = u_q \})
\end{align*}

We define the greatest contiguously-mismatching length as follows,
\begin{align*}
n(t, u) = \max(\{i - j \forall i, j \in 0..n-1 \mid \forall q \in i..j, t_q \neq u_q \})
\end{align*}

The streak metric $S'$  with tags $t$ and $u$
\begin{align*}
S'(t, u)
= \frac{ p(n(t,u)) }{p(m(t,u)) + p(n(t,u))}.
\end{align*}
where $p$ approximates the probability of a contiguously-matching substring between

It is worth noting that the formula for computing the probability of a $k$-bit match or mismatch, given by Downing as follows, is actually mathematically flawed.
\begin{align*}
p_k
= \frac{n - k + 1}{2^k}
\end{align*}

The probability of a $0$-bit match according to this formula would be computed as $p_0 = \frac{n - 0 + 1}{2^0} = n + 1$ which is clearly impossible because $p_0 > 1 \forall n > 0$.
The actual can probability be achieved using a lookup table computed using dynamic programming.

However, the formula Downing presented provides a useful approximation to the probability of a $k$ bit match.
For computational efficiency and consistency with the existing literature we use clamp edge cases between 0 and 1 to yield the corrected streak metric $S$.

\begin{align*}
S(t, u) =
\max( \min( S'(t, u), 1), 0)
\end{align*}
