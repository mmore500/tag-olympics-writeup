\section{Geometric Analyses} \label{sec:geometric}

In this section, we consider the geometry that tag matching metrics construct over bitstring tag space.


Geometric constraints of tag matching metrics may affect the patterns of tag connectivity that tend to, or even can, arise under a
In a constrained, it is possible for there to be two queries such that no operand can match both queries well.
Likewise, it is possible for there to be two queries such that an operand must match both queries well.

Structure might prove useful to facilitate modularity, where subsets of tag space tend to have associated functionality.
However, it may also constrain the ease (or possibility) at which adaptive variation can be generated.

To get at these questions, we compare distributions of two statistics measuring constraint across our five tag-matching metrics.
\input{fig/dimensionality_measure.tex}

The first statistic we calculate is similarity constraint.
This statistic quantifies the question, "If two tags both match closely to a third tag, will they necessarily match closely with each other?"
To compute this statistic, we randomly sampled 5000 target tags.
Then, for each target tag we randomly sampled tags until we found two secondarily-sampled tags that were within a 0.01 match distance radius to the target.
Finally, we computed the match distance between the pair of seconarily-sampled tags.
Figure \ref{fig:dimensionality_measure}(a) summarizes this process.

The second statistic we calculate is dissimilarity constraint.
This statistic quantifies the question, "If a tag matches a second tag closely and a third tag poorly, will the second and third tag tend to match poorly?"
To compute this statistic, we randomly sampled 5000 target tags.
Then, for each target tag we randomly sampled tags until we found a secondarily-sampled tag that was within a 0.01 match distance radius of the target and a secondarily-sampled tag that was outside a 0.99 match distance radius of the target.
Finally, we computed the match distance between the pair of secondarily-sampled tags.
Figure \ref{fig:dimensionality_measure}(a) summarizes this process.

\subsection{Similarity Constraint}

\input{fig/sphere.tex}

In a euclidean space, the similarity constraint metric would correspond to the average distance between points uniformly sampled from inside a ball (e.g., in two dimensions a circle, in three dimensions a sphere, etc.).
Average distance between such points increases with dimensionality.
For reference, in a one dimensional Euclidean space similarity constraint would measure approximately 0.0067.
In a two dimensional Euclidean space, it would measure approximately  0.0091.
In 32 dimensions, it would measure 0.0137 \citep{dunbar1997average}.

Figure \ref{fig:sphere_barplot} provides our estimate of the similarity constraint statistic for each metric, with error bars representing a 95\% confidence interval.
Figure \ref{fig:sphere_distnplot} shows the distribution of the similarity constraint statistic values among the 5000 replicate samples in greater detail.

For the bidirectional integer metric, we measured the similarity constraint statistic as 0.0068.
This falls in line with expectation: this metric is essentially identical to a one-dimensional Euclidean space.
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:sphere_distnplot}, the secondarily-sampled match distances are all bounded by the diameter of 0.02.
This metric not only exhibits tight similarity constraint in the mean case, but also permits no outliers to the similarity constraint.

The unidirectional integer metric exhibits much looser similarity constraint in the mean case.
We estimated this value as 0.5092.
However, this looser similarity constraint appears to be an artifiact of averaging between two very tight constraints: a tight constraint to 0 in one case and a tight constraint to 1 in the other.
In Figure \ref{fig:sphere_distnplot}, you can clearly see that all sampled cases fall under one of these umbrellas.
This phenomenon results from the asymmetrical definition of the metric.
If you sample pairs of similar values, half will be in ascending order (resulting in a match distance close to 0) and half will be in descending order, (resulting in a wraparound search and a match distance close to 1).
Averaging these outcomes out yields the observed mean value of 0.5.
The integer metric appears to allow for closely related tags to either very strongly match or very weakly match, but permits no intermediate outcomes.

The hamming metric exhibits a broader range of sampled similarity constraint values than the integer metrics.
We estimated mean similarity constraint as 0.1627, looser than the bidirectional integer metric.
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:sphere_distnplot}, many secondarily-sampled tag pairs are biased towards low match distances.
However, secondarily-sampled tag pairs that break this low match distance constraint are also not uncommon.
Among our 5,000 trials, we observed distances between secondarily-sampled tags as high as 0.7499.

Why is our estimate of the hamming metric similarity constraint statistic so much higher than expected in a 32-dimensional Euclidean space?
This phenomenon appears to be due to the normalization process we applied to map raw match distances to a uniform distribution.
We also calculated this statistic for the raw hamming metric without normalization.
For practical reasons, we increased the radius of our sampling sphere to 0.25.
(Only the exact target 32-bit tag satisfies within-sphere constraint with a sampling radius of 0.01.)
In 32-dimensional euclidean space with a sampling radius of 0.25, the expected distance between sampled points is 0.3415.
Our estimate of the raw hamming metric's similarity constraint statistic falls nearly in line with expectation at 0.3312.

The streak metric exhibited the next-loosest similarity constraint statistic with a mean value sampled at 0.2813.
For this metric, we observed distances between secondarily-sampled tags as high as 0.9993.
The streak metric retains some geometric constraint in the mean case, but outliers that strongly break similarity constraint are also not uncommon.

Like the integer metric, the hash metric also exhibits looser similarity constraint in the mean case.
We estimated this value as 0.5083 for the hash metric.
However, unlike the integer metric, intermediate secondarily-sampled match distances are also are possible.
In fact, secondarily-sampled match distances are uniformly distributed.
This is exactly as we would expect:
given any particular set of operands, a well-behaved hash function should yield a uniform distribution of hash results.
The hash metric exhibits no geometric structure and total geometric flexibility.

\subsection{Dissimilarity Constraint}

\input{fig/sphere_reverse.tex}

Figure \ref{fig:sphere_barplot} provides our estimate of the dissimilarity constraint statistic for each metric, with error bars representing a 95\% confidence interval.
Figure \ref{fig:sphere_distnplot} shows the distribution of the dissimilarity constraint statistic values among the 5000 replicate samples in greater detail.

These results tell a story across metrics very to the simiarity constraint results.
The hash metric exhibited no geometric structure.
The streak metric exhibited some geometric structure in the mean case (mean secondarily-sampled distance 0.7127), but outcomes that strongly broke geometric constraints were also observed (we observed distances between secondarily-sampled tags as low as 0.0002).
The hamming metric exhibited stronger geometric structure in the mean case (mean secondarily-sampled distance 0.8248) and had less extreme tail-end outcomes (we observed match distances between the secondarily-sampled tags only as low as 0.2355).
The bidirectional integer metric was highly constrained in both the mean and tail-end cases.
The smallest distance between secondarily-sampled tags was 0.9802.
Again, the unidirectional integer metric exhibited a quirky result due to its noncommutative nature.
The mean distance between secondarily-sampled tags was 0.0100.
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:sphere_distnplot}, all secondarily-sampled distances oberved with this metric were extremely small.
Under this metric, if you sample a tag that is close to a target it will be numerically slightly larger than the target.
Likewise, if you sample a tag that is very far from a target, it will be numerically slightly smaller than the target (due to wraparound).
Then, explaining this counterintuitive result, the distance from the slightly smaller to the larger tag will be small.
