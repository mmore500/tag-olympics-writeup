\subsection{Bidirectional Integer Metric} \label{sec:bidirectionalinteger}

The bidirectional integer metric computes match distance between tags $t$ and $u$ by counting from $t$ to $u$.
The count from $t$ to $u$ ascends or descends, whichever is shorter.
If necessary, the count wraps around at $0$ and $2^n$.

The binteger metric interprets bitstring tags $t$ and $u$ as unsigned integers using the same mapping, $f$, as the integer metric.

Formally, the bidirectional integer metric computes distance between $n$-bit bitstring tags as,
\begin{align*}
d(t, u) =
\min
\begin{cases}
  \frac{2^n - \max\big(f(t), f(u)\big) + \min\big(f(t), f(u)\big)}{2^n}, \\
  \frac{\max\big(f(t), f(u)\big) - \min\big(f(t), f(u)\big)}{2^n}.
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

We included this metric to contrast with the integer metric. In particular, we wished to shed light on any consequences of its asymmetry and discontinuity.
In figure axes and legends with tight space constraints, we refer to this metric as ``Integer (bi)''.
