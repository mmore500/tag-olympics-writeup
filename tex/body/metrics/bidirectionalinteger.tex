\subsection{Bidirectional Integer Metric} \label{sec:bidirectionalinteger}

The bidirectional integer metric computes match distance between tags $t$ and $u$ by counting from $t$ to $u$.
The count from $t$ to $u$ ascends or descends, whichever is shorter.
If necessary, the count wraps around at $0$ and $2^n$.

The bidirectional integer metric interprets bitstring tags $t$ and $u$ as unsigned integers using the same mapping, $f$, as the integer metric.

Formally, the bidirectional integer metric computes distance between $n$-bit bitstring tags as,
\begin{align*}
d(t, u) =
  \frac{\min \Big(f(u) - f(t)  \mod 2^n, f(t) - f(u) \mod 2^n \Big)}{2^n}. \\
\end{align*}

We included this metric to contrast with the integer metric. In particular, we wished to shed light on any consequences of its asymmetry and discontinuity.
In figure axes and legends with tight space constraint, we refer to this metric as ``Integer (bi).''

As an example, consider again the eight bit tags $t = \langle 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1 \rangle$ and $u = \langle 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1 \rangle$.
As before, the tag $t$ encodes the integer value 147 and the tag $u$ encodes the integer value 35.
We already found that counting from $t$ to $u$ mod 256 takes 144 steps.
Counting from $u$ to $t$ mod 256 takes only 112 steps (i.e., $147 - 35$).
So, we pick the shorter route and normalize by 256 to give the match distance 0.4375.
