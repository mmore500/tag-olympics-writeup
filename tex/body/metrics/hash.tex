\subsection{Hash Metric} \label{sec:hash}

To our knowledge, the hash metric is original to this work.
The metric produces an arbitrary, but deterministic, match distance between any two tags.
In other words, the tag matching space is completely unstructured.
We include it primarily to serve as a control.

The hash metric calculates match distance via a cryptographic hash of tags $t$ and $u$.
First, we concatenate $t$ and $u$ into a double-width bitstring $v$ such that
\begin{align*}
v = \langle t_0, t_1, t_2, \dots, t_{n-2}, t_{n-1}, u_0, u_1, u_2, \dots, u_{n-2}, u_{n-1} \rangle
\end{align*}

Then, we use the OpenSSL library to generate a \texttt{std::string} digest of $v$.
We then apply \texttt{std::hash} to map this digest to a \texttt{std::size\_t}, $v'$.
Finally, we perform a floating point division to compute the matching distance as $d(t, u) = v' / \hat{V}$ where $\hat{V}$  denotes the maximum representable \texttt{std::size\_t} value.
