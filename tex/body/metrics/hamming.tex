\subsection{Hamming Metric} \label{sec:hamming}

The Hamming metric computes match distance as the fraction of positions between tags $t$ and $u$ with mismatching bits.
Formally, for $n$-bit bitstring tags,
\begin{align*}
d(t, u)
= \frac{
  \#\{ i : t_i \neq u_i, i=0, \dots ,n-1\}
}{
  n
}.
\end{align*}

As an example, consider eight bit tags $t = \langle 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1 \rangle$ and $u = \langle 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1 \rangle$.
Sites 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 match.
Sites 0, 2, and 3 mismatch.
Because 3 sites mismatch, the Hamming metric would compute match distance as $3 / 8 = 0.375$.

This metric is based on \cite{lalejini2019else}, originally after \cite{hamming1950error}.
