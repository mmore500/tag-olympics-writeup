\subsection{Hamming Metric} \label{sec:hamming}

The Hamming metric computes match distance as the fraction of positions between tags $t$ and $u$ with mismatching bits.
Formally, for $n$-bit bitstring tags,
\begin{align*}
d(t, u)
= \frac{
  \#\{ i : t_i \neq u_i, i=0, \dots ,n-1\}
}{
  n
}.
\end{align*}

This metric is based on \cite{lalejini2019else}, originally after \cite{hamming1950error}.
