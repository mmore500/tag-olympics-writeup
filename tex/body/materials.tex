\section{Code, Data, and Reproducibility}

The code used to perform and analyze our experiments, our figures, and data from our experiments is available via the Open Science Framework at \url{https://osf.io/gw5mc/} \citep{foster2017open}.
Data and figures are also organized alongside related manuscript source files at \url{https://github.com/mmore500/tag-olympics-writeup}.

We implemented our experimental systems using the MatchBin tool suite included in the Empirical library for scientific software development in C++, available at \url{https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical} \citep{charles_ofria_2019_2575607}.
Software written for these experiments is available at \url{https://github.com/amlalejini/Exploring-tag-matching-metrics-in-SignalGP/tree/1.0} and \url{https://github.com/mmore500/tag-olympics}.
