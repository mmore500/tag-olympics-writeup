\section{Variational Analysis} \label{sec:variational}

In Section \ref{sec:geometric} we investigated how existing tag-match relationships to a common tag influenced the distribution of match distances.
This section, in contrast, focuses on how individual mutations and cumulative sequences of mutations affect a single tag-matching relationship.
Here, we use bit flip mutation operator.
This approach enables straightforward, direct comparison between metrics.
However, as a result, these analyses do not explore alternate, more semantic approaches to mutation --- especially pertinent for integer tagging schemes where a tag's integer value can be directly manipulated, for example by adding or subtracting a normally-distributed amount.\footnote{
Although not universal, use of bit flip mutation operators with integer representations is not entirely uncommon.
See e.g., \cite{downing2015intelligence}.
}
Any extrapolation of these results to systems with different mutation operators should be made with carefully consideration, and may merit additional experimentation or analysis.

In Section \ref{sec:single_step}, we report two single-step mutational analyses: one that examines the local mutational neighborhoods of loosely-affiliated and a second that examines the local mutational neighborhoods of tightly-affiliated tag pairs.
In Section \ref{sec:mutational_walks}, we perform mutational walk analysis to survey the broader mutational landscape.

\subsection{Single-Step Mutations} \label{sec:single_step}

\input{fig/mutational_step.tex}

We performed single-step mutational analyses to characterize the local mutational neighborhoods induced by each tag-matching metric.

To measure this effect of mutation on loosely-affiliated tag pairs, we
\begin{itemize}
    \item randomly sampled a target tag $R$,
    \item randomly sampled candidate tags until we found a second tag $S$ with a match distance $> 0.5$,
    \item recorded match distance $d$ between $R$ and $S$,
    \item applied a one-bit mutation to the secondary tag $S$, yielding a mutated variant $S'$,
    \item measured the match distance $d'$ between $R$ and $S'$,
    \item and then calculated change in match distance under mutation $p = d' - d$.
\end{itemize}
We repeated this procedure to generate 5,000 samples.

The top panel of Figure \ref{fig:mutational_step} visualizes the distribution of match distance change under mutation of loosely-affiliated tags.
A negative mutational perturbation $p$ indicates a decrease in match distance and, therefore, an increase in match quality (colored blue in Figure \ref{fig:mutational_step}).
A positive mutational perturbation $p$ indicates an increase in match distance and, therefore, an decrease in match quality (colored red in Figure \ref{fig:mutational_step}).

We used a similar procedure to measure the distribution of mutational perturbations on tightly-matched tag pairs, except that we uniformly sampled until we found a second tag $S$ with match distance $< 0.01$.
The bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:mutational_step}, color coded identically to the top panel, visualizes the distribution of match distance change under mutation of tightly-affiliated tags.
This distribution reflects the effects of one-step mutations on tags with pre-existing affinity.

\subsubsection{Integer and Bidirectional Integer Metrics}

For both tightly- and loosely-affiliated tag pairs under the integer and bidirectional integer metrics, most mutations caused very small changes in match distance.
These mutations toggle least-significant bits of the tag's integer representation.
However, under these metrics, a small fraction of mutations affecting more-significant bits of the integer representation have a much stronger effect.
Single-step mutations occasionally occured that strongly couple loosely-affiliated tag pairs or strongly decouple tightly-affiliated tag pairs.
In particular, the unidirectional integer metric appears to exhibit more frequent strong decoupling mutations than the bidirectional integer metric, presumably due to its non-commutative quirks.

\subsubsection{Streak Metric}

Unlike all other metrics, the streak metric frequently yields perfectly neutral outcomes under mutation.
With loose affinity, 56\% of all mutations were perfectly neutral.
With tight affinity, 45\% of all mutations were perfectly neutral.
These perfectly-neutral mutations presumably affect regions of the bitstring involved in neither the longest-matching streak nor the longest-mismatching streak.
The streak metric exhibits a thicker tail of mutational magnitude for mutations that couple loosely-affiliated tags than the integer metrics.
In addition, the most extreme mutational outcomes that couple loosely-affiliated tags appear to be of a comparable magnitude to those under the integer metrics.
Mechanistically, this might be due to mutations that disrupt longest-mismatching streaks.
However, one-step mutations that decouple tightly-affiliated tags do not appear as potent.
This might be because achieving a very poor match requires both increasing longest-mismatching streak length and decreasing longest-matching streak length.

\subsubsection{Hamming Metric}

The Hamming metric exhibits a generally uniform magnitude of match-distance changes under mutation.
High-magnitude one-step mutations do not occur under this metric.
(Without normalizing match distance to a uniform distribution for randomly-sampled tags, all Hamming metric mutations would be of exactly the same magnitude, either increasing or decreasing the count of matching bits by 1.)

\subsubsection{Hash Metric}

The hash metric exhibits the thickest tails of mutational magnitude of all metrics.
Extreme-effect one-step mutations are plentiful under this metric.
Interestingly, compared to other metrics, the hash metric exhibits a greater fraction of mutations that reduce affinity between tightly-affiliated tags and a greater fraction of mutations that increase affinity between loosely-affiliated tags.
This result can be attributed to the hash metric's lack of geometric structure.
Because all one-step mutations uniformly sample a new match distance, 99.5\% of one-step mutations on tightly-affiliated tags will result in a looser coupling.
Similarly, approximately 75\% of one-step mutations on loosely-affiliated tags will result in a tighter coupling.

\subsection{Mutational Walks} \label{sec:mutational_walks}

\input{fig/mutational_walk_barplot.tex}

We performed multi-step mutational analyses to characterize the broader mutational landscapes induced by each tag-matching metric.
To conduct these mutational walks, we
\begin{itemize}
    \item randomly generated a starting tag,
    \item then sequentially applied randomly-chosen one-step bit flip mutations to that tag until a mutational saturation threshold,
    \item while recording match distance to the original starting tag at each step along the walk.
\end{itemize}
Back mutation was allowed in these experiments.
We performed 65 step mutational walks, which allowed us to include a binary order of magnitude past one expected mutation per site.
We analyzed 1,000 replicate mutational walks for each metric, which was sufficient to distinguish metrics with bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals

Figure \ref{fig:mutational_walk_barplot} compares how match distance increases along mutational walks for each tag-matching metric.

\subsubsection{Hash Metric}

Due to the hash metric's lack of geometric structure the hash metric, bitwise equivalent tags do not exhibit low match distance.
So, as expected, throughout the entire mutational walk this metric maintains a constant mean match distance of 0.5.

\subsubsection{Integer Metric and Bidirectional Integer Metric}
\label{sec:mutation_integer}

The binary representation of the integer and bidirectional integer metrics (Section \ref{sec:integer}) induces a long-tailed distribution of mutational effect sizes.
Under this distribution, value changes of each binary order of magnitude are equally likely (corresponding to toggling the bit at each position).
Occasional large-effect mutations provides a plausible explanation for the bidirectional integer metric's rapid increase in match distance under mutation relative to the Hamming and streak metrics.
The integer metric experiences even more rapid dilation of match distance under mutation.
Under this metric, half of first mutational steps cause a wraparound effect, immediately spiking the average match distance to 0.5.
Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:mutational_walk_lineplot} shows match distance variance decreasing as the integer metric mutational walk proceeds away from match distances biased to 0 or 1.

\subsubsection{Hamming Metric}

The Hamming metric's match distance diffuses upward slowest.
The Hamming metric's mutational walk is significantly slower to diverge than the streak metric's at 16 and 32 steps (non-overlapping 95\% CI).
It is significantly slower to diverge than the integer metrics and the hash metric between steps 1 and 32, as well (non-overlapping 95\% CI).

\subsubsection{Streak Metric}

The streak metric diffuses away from zero match distance second-slowest, trailed only by the Hamming metric.

Interestingly, this result contradicts Downing's presentation of the streak metric in \citep{downing2015intelligence}, in which he suggests that the streak metric exhibits \textit{greater} robustness because its match distance diverges more slowly under a mutational walk.
This discrepancy presumably arises due to our uniformification to ensure a uniform distribution of raw match scores between 0 and 1 (Section \ref{sec:uniformification}).
We believe that our result under uniformification is more representative because match distance corresponds to the probability that arbitrary tags would match more strongly by chance --- which directly relates to how effectively a operand tag competes to be the ``best'' match for a query.

To compare mutational landscapes between the streak and integer metrics under more realistic circumstances (i.e., where tags do not begin exactly perfectly-matched), we performed a secondary mutational walk experiment.
This experiment was conducted exactly as before, except instead of starting with exactly-identical tags it started with a pair of tags that was randomly sampled for match distance $<0.01$.

As shown in Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:mutational_walk_sampled_start_barplot}, this experiment confirmed greater robustness of the Hamming metric under mutation.
The streak metric's match distance was significantly greater than the Hamming metric between mutational steps 2 and 16 (non-overlapping 95\% CI).
Our result remained consistent when replicating the experiment with 64-bit tags (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:mutational_walk_sampled_start_64_barplot}).
