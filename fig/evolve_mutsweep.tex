\caption{
Survey of adaptive evolution rates across mutation rates for 32-vertex graph-matching task with randomly-initialized initial genomes.
Metrics exhibited fastest adaptive evolution within the range of mutation rates surveyed, except the hash metric which exhibited fastest adaptive evolution at at the lowest mutation rate surveyed.
Maximum fitness is the best fitness value for any individual within a population.
Maximum fitness at each update is presented across the range of surveyed mutation rates.
Error bars represent bootstrap 95\% confidence intervals across 50 replicate populations.
