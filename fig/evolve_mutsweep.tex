\caption{
32-node graph-matching task mutation rate sensitivity analysis.
Metrics exhibited fastest adaptive evolution within the range of mutation rates surveyed, except the hash metric which exhibited fastest adaptive evolution at at the lowest mutation rate surveyed. 
Maximum fitness represents the best fitness value for any individual within a population.
Maximum fitness at each update is presented across the range of surveyed mutation rates.
Error bars represent bootstrap 95\% confidence intervals across 20 replicate populations.
