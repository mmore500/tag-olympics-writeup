\caption{
Distributions of detour distance difference for triplets of randomly sampled tags.
Each bar sliver represents an independently sampled triplet A, B, and C.
A value of 2.0 indicates that the distance AC was zero and that the distances AB and BC were both 1.
A value of 0.0 indicates that the distance AC was equal to the distance AB plus AC.
A negative value (colored red) indicates violation of the triangle inequality: the distance AC is greater than the distance AB plus BC.
A value of -1.0 indicates the distance AC was equal to 1 but the distances AB and BC were both equal to zero.
