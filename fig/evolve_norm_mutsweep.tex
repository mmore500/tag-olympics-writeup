\caption{
Survey of adaptive evolution rates across mutation rates for 32-node graph-matching task with normally-distributed mutation.
Maximum fitness is the best fitness value for any individual within a population.
Maximum fitness at each update is presented across the range of surveyed mutation rates.
Mutation rate is the standard deviation of mutational difference applied to tags each generation.
Error bars represent bootstrap 95\% confidence intervals across 100 replicate populations.
